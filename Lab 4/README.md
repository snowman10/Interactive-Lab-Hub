## Part 1 Lab Preparation

### Get the latest content

### Start brainstorming ideas by reading

### Gathering materials for this lab:

* Cardboard (start collecting those shipping boxes!)
* Found objects and materials--like bananas and twigs.
* Cutting board
* Cutting tools
* Markers

* New hardware for your kit will be handed out. Update your parts list. 


(We do offer shared cutting board, cutting tools, and markers on the class cart during the lab, so do not worry if you don't have them!)

## Deliverables \& Submission for Lab 4

The deliverables for this lab are, writings, sketches, photos, and videos that show what your prototype:
* "Looks like": shows how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
* "Works like": shows what the device can do.
* "Acts like": shows how a person would interact with the device.

For submission, the readme.md page for this lab should be edited to include the work you have done:
* Upload any materials that explain what you did, into your lab 4 repository, and link them in your lab 4 readme.md.
* Link your Lab 4 readme.md in your main Interactive-Lab-Hub readme.md. 
* Group members can turn in one repository, but make sure your Hub readme.md links to the shared repository.
* Labs are due on Mondays, make sure to submit your Lab 4 readme.md to Canvas.

## The Report (Part 1: A-D, Part 2: E-F)

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction 


### Part B
### More sensors

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

#### Rotary Encoder (optional)

> **_NOTE:_**  Not in the kit yet - skip this.

#### Joystick (optional)

#### Distance Sensor

### Part C
### Physical considerations for sensing

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches of different ways you might use your sensor, and how the larger device needs to be shaped in order to make the sensor useful.\*\*\***

* Interactive Whack-A-Mole
  * Two Distance Sensors
  * One Button
  * Four Pairs of Red and Green LEDs
![](./img/img1.png)
* Claw Machine
* Ice Cream Game
* Snake
* One-Man Band

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

* How to implement proximity sensors and accurately quantize the joystick positions.
* How accurate distance sensors are when hand is above them
* Responsiveness of button

**\*\*\*Pick one of these designs to prototype.\*\*\***

* Interactive Whack-A-Mole

### Part D
### Physical considerations for displaying information and housing parts

**\*\*\*Sketch 5 designs for how you would physically position your display and any buttons or knobs needed to interact with it.\*\*\***

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

**\*\*\*Pick one of these display designs to integrate into your prototype.\*\*\***

**\*\*\*Explain the rationale for the design.\*\*\*** 

**\*\*\*Document your rough prototype.\*\*\***

"Looks Like": For this lab we made a whack a mole, but we changed the moles to flies. The device is made out of cardboard. It is a box with 4 pairs of LEDs attached on top of it. We put flies over the LEDs so the flies light up. There is also a swatter on the side for the users to hit the flies.

"Works Like": Each game is timed, the user's aim is to hit as many flies as they can in the time limit. The red LEDs on the device lights up to show which flies the users should hit. The green LED lights up to indicate that the fly has been hit. A score of the user will be displayed at the end.

"Acts Like": The user can hit the fly using the swatter at the side. He/she needs to hit the fly that lights up red.
